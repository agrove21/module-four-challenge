## Description
I created a two-page website where users can input and view blog posts. It includes a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and the ability to toggle a light or dark mode.
-   Designed an index and blog page.
-   Created a form to input data and implement it on the blog page.
-   Implemented a toggle switch for light or dark mode.
-   Added a back button to add more input to create more blog posts.

Also, I learned how to implement Javascript work with localStorage and how to structure more complex directories with multiple folders and files.

CODE SOURCE NOTE: I worked with a tutor on this assignment.
